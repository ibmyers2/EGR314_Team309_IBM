## Decision Making Process

Since my main responsibility for my team was to make the human machine interface, I decided that the best selection for the microcontroller would be the ESP32. This is because the ESP is I2C compatible, which would work well with many of the OLED screen options I would have to choose from. The ESP is also capable of Wifi communication, which is the method of communication between the rest of the system and me. For the buttons, the regular pushbuttons were simple surface mount buttons that didn't take up much space. For the HMI buttons, these were selected later on to be more user-friendly and more appealing. The OLED screen is one that I was more familiar with and met the simplicity of our project.
